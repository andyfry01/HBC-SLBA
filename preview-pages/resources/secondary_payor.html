	<h2 id="focus-target">Definition for Secondary Payor Status for Student Administrative Health Fees (SAHF)</h2>
		
	<p>
     The federal government, in regulations for student health insurance/benefit plans issued on March 21 2012, designated pre-fundign arrangements for college health and counseling services as being "Student Administrative Health Fees" (refer to <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-03-21/html/2012-6359.htm">CMS-9981-F.</a>), hereafter refer to as "SAHF." 
     <BR><BR>
     Even though SAHF is not a form of health insurance, many state regulatory authorities consider SAHF to still fall within the definition of a “plan” in their Coordination of Benefit statutes/regulations (COB) as it is construed to be a "group-type contract" (refer to Appendix B in the HB&L report entitled <a href="https://hbc-docrepo2.wordsecure.com/docs/request_repository.php?id=72">Considering Insurance Billing for College Health and Counseing Services</a>). Pragmatically, in these states SAHF is precluded from being used to fund remaining balances for copayments, deductibles, and coinsurance under students’ personal health insurance plans. It is noteworthy that student health insurance plans that provide accident-only coverage (e.g., plans that cover only intercolle-giate sports injuries) are permitted to take secondary payor positions by being excluded from their state’s definition of “plan” under COB in most states.
    </p>
    <p>In contrast to the regulatory siuation described above, there are at least seven states that allow SAHF to take an alawys secondary payor position in coordination of benefits with student's personal health insurance (e.g., Minnesota, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania). It is important to note that the basis for this situation is often unique to a specific state's regulatory enviornment. In our experience, working with the assistance of attorneys specialzing insurance regulatory law (e.g., <a href="https://www.FORC.org">The Federation of Regulatory Council</a>) and government relations staf, state insurance departments may respond favorably to an inquiry about secondary payor status given that is is not unprecdented, is highly favorable to consumers to assure that SAHF does not unnecessarily dupliate students' personal health insuarnce, and the federal government has clearly established that SAHF is not a form of health insurance.
