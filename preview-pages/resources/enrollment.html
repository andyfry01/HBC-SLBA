        <strong>Voluntary Coverage – The student does not obtain coverage unless he or she proactively submits premium
          directly to the insurance carrier and/or completes a form authorizing premium to be added to his or her
          tuition fee billing.</strong>
      </p>

      <li>
        <p>
          <u>Voluntary</u>: The college or university does not require health insurance as a condition of enrollment.
          The
          student pays
          his or her insurance premium directly to the insurance carrier by mail or to an agent.
          <br />

      <li>
        <p>
          <u>Positive Check-Off</u>: The college or university does not require health insurance as a condition of
          enrollment. The student may
          purchase health insurance by adding the cost to his or her tuition /fee billing.
          <br />

          <br />

          <strong>Forced Answer Systems</strong> are between voluntary and various forms of insurance requirement.

          <u>Forced Answer</u>: The college or university does not require health insurance as a condition of
          enrollment.
          The student,
          however, is not allowed to complete the registration or fee payment process until a response is given to the
          question of accepting or declining health insurance coverage.

          <strong>
            <span class="small">Forms of Insurance Requirements – The student is automatically enrolled in the SHIBP if
              he
              or
              she does not take action to have the cost of coverage removed from the college’s or university’s
              tuition/fee
              billing.

      <li>
        <p>
          <u>Negative Check-Off</u>: The college or university does not require health insurance as a condition of
          enrollment. The student is
          charged for health insurance if a check-off on the tuition/fee billing is not made. The student will also be
          billed if the form is not returned.
          <br />

      <li>
        <p>
          <u>“Loose” Waiver</u>: The college or university requires either health insurance as a condition of enrollment
          or that the
          student certify that he or she has adequate financial resources to pay for unexpected medical expenses. The
          student is charged for the institution’s health insurance plan if he or she does not submit a waiver request
          during a specified enrollment period. The college or university only requires the student to certify (usually
          by
          checking a statement) he or she has health insurance coverage. Loose waiver enrollment systems may be
          augmented
          with random audits to verify insurance coverage for students waiving participation in the institution's health
          insurance plan.

      <li>
        <p>
          <u>“Restrictive” Waiver</u>: The college or university requires health insurance as a condition of enrollment.
          The student is charged
          for health insurance if he or she does not submit a waiver request during a specified enrollment period. The
          student must prove health insurance coverage exists by providing a copy of an insurance identification card,
          letter from an employer or insurance carrier, or some other physical evidence of coverage. These enrollment
          systems may include minimum level of coverage requirements (e.g., pregnancy benefits, deductible, plan
          maximum,
          mental health care coverage, etc.). The coverage requirements must be satisfied before the waiver request is
          granted.

      <li>
        <p>
          <u>Right of Refund</u>: This enrollment system is the same as the loose or restrictive waiver system previously described,
          except
          all students are required to pay the premium and then obtain a refund of premium.
          <br />

        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          <u>Completely Mandatory</u>: All students, or a given class of students (e.g., international student, graduate
          student, on-campus
          resident, etc.) are required to purchase the college- or university-sponsored health insurance program as a
          condition of enrollment. There is no waiver or refund option.
