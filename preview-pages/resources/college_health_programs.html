	<h1 class="mb-5" id="focus-target">The Lookout Mountain Group's Definition for College Health Programs</h1>



	<p>The College Health Program concept was fully developed by the <a href="http://lookoutmountaingroup.net/">Lookout
			Mountain Group</a> in its 2009 report <a href="https://docs.hbc-slba.com/access/45/"><i>"Analysis and Policy
				Recommendations for Provding Health Insurance and Health Care Services for the College Student
				Population."</i></a> (the complete definition is also available in the document repository as
		Appendix_A___CHP_Definition.pdf)
	</p>

	<p class="ml-3">
		<i>“A College Health Program describes the constellation of services, strategies, policies, and facilities an
			institution of higher education assembles to advance the health of its students. While some College Health
			Programs are also intended to provide extensive services for faculty and staff, most of the components are
			intended to provide services exclusively for eligible students. On many campuses, College Health Programs
			are wholly focused on the provision of health care in the form of medical, nursing, and psychological
			services and may include a variety of health care related services including sports medicine services for
			intercollegiate athletes, student health insurance/benefit programs, crisis intervention and public safety
			services. On some campuses there will be a Chief Health Officer reporting to the Provost or the President.
			On many campuses traditional health care delivery services are clustered with health promotion related
			services including personal wellness skills development, community advocacy for sexual misconduct
			prevention, environmental management for alcohol abuse prevention, and facilities for intramural recreation
			and fitness programs.”</i>

		Over the past 12 years, Hodgkins Beckley Consulting has also been giving thought to what constitutes a College
		Health Program (e.g.,<a href="/pages/resources/Chronicle2005.pdf"><i>“Six Major Challenges Facing Student Health
				Programs,</a>”</i> Chronicle of Higher Education, January, 2005).
