  <h1>Definition for College Health Programs</h1>
 
  <p>
    For more than 10 years we have been giving thought to what constitutes a College Health Pro-gram (e.g.,<a href="https://hbc-slba.com/#!/resources/Chronicle2005"><i>“Six Major Challenges Facing Student Health Programs,””</i> Chronicle of Higher Education, January,2005</a>).
  </p>

  <p>The College Health Program concept was fully developed by the Lookout Mountain Group in its 2009 report <a href="https://hbc-docrepo2.wordsecure.com/docs/request_repository.php?id=151"><i>Analysis and Policy Recommendations for Provding Health Insurance and Health Care Services for the College Student Population."</i></a>
  </p>

  <p>
    <i>“A College Health Program describes the constellation of services, strategies, policies, and facilities an institution of higher education assembles to advance the health of its students. While some College Health Programs are also intended to provide extensive services for faculty and staff, most of the components are intended to provide services exclusively for eligible students. On many campuses, College Health Programs are whol-ly focused on the provision of health care in the form of medical, nursing, and psycho-logical services and may include a variety of health care related services including sports medicine services for intercollegiate athletes, student health insurance/benefit pro-grams, crisis intervention and public safety services. On some campuses there will be a Chief Health Officer reporting to the Provost or the President. On many campuses tradi-tional health care delivery services are clustered with health promotion related services including personal wellness skills development, community advocacy for sexual miscon-duct prevention, environmental management for alcohol abuse prevention, and facili-ties for intramural recreation and fitness programs.”</i>

<p>
The Lookout Mountain Group provided an operation definition for the following service compo-nent with a summary comment on health-related services that could be incorporated into a Col-lege Health Program:
</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Public Health
    </li>
    <li>
      Clinical Medical Care Services
    </li>
    <li>
      Clinical Psychological Health Care Services
    </li>
    <li>
      Student Health Insurance/Benefit Programs
    </li>
    <li>
      Health Promotion
    </li>
  </ul>
  <P><i>“College Health Programs often have responsibility for a variety of health-related services or responsibility for health care services for distinct sub-populations. Sports medicine and athletic training services for intercollegiate athletes is an example of a special service. Other examples include services for students with disabilities, sexual misconduct advocacy ser-vices, learning disability assessments, services for faculty and staff, special services for in-ternational students and students traveling abroad, dedicated clinics for care of children, and services for specialized student populations such as students in the performing arts that have high frequency for injury."</i>
