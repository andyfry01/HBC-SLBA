			At Cornell, she was responsible for the creation of enabling legislation to allow for student health plans to be self-funded in New York State (NYS). Under Ms. Lyon’s direction, Cornell became the first higher education institution in New York to self-fund
			its student health plan, resulting in annual administrative savings of 8 percent or about $2.4 million per year. Concurrently to this initiative, she was the driving force behind a pilot program with the NYS Department of Health to offer annual premium
			assistance to approximately 400 Medicaid-eligible students. This action resulted in substantial savings to NYS and provided access to quality health insurance to low income Cornell students. Other states have implemented similar programs, and the American
			College Health Association (ACHA) has since endorsed national advocacy of this initiative. She also helped to implement a pre-paid funding system that equalized access to care for students, regardless of income or insurance status; and helped achieve
			a $55 million building expansion and renovation project, housing fully integrated health and counseling services.
