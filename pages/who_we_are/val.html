      Valerie Lyon has over 30 years of experience in health care administration

      >. Prior to joining HB&L, she served for 20 years as the Chief
      Administrative and Fiscal Officer of Cornell Health at Cornell University.

    <p>
      Ms. Lyon’s operational expertise includes provider and vendor contracting,
      employee health, pharmacy oversight and management, physician and hospital
      community relations, strategic planning, human resource management, and

      At Cornell, she was a leader in the creation of enabling legislation to
      allow for student health plans to be self-funded in New York State (NYS).
      Under Ms. Lyon’s direction, Cornell became the first higher education
      institution in New York to self-fund its student health plan, resulting in
      annual administrative savings of 8 percent or about $2.4 million per year.
      Concurrently to this initiative, she was the driving force behind a pilot
      program with the NYS Department of Health to offer annual premium
      assistance to approximately 400 Medicaid-eligible students. This action
      resulted in substantial savings to NYS and provided access to quality
      health insurance to low income Cornell students. Other states have
      implemented similar programs, and the American College Health Association
      (ACHA) has since endorsed national advocacy of this initiative. She also
      helped to implement a pre-paid funding system that equalized access to
      care for students, regardless of income or insurance status; and helped
      achieve a $55 million building expansion and renovation project, housing
      fully integrated health and counseling services.

      Insurance/Benefits Coalition and was chair of the ACHA Coalition during
      the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. She has held a
      faculty appointment at Cornell, serving as Executive in Residence for the
      Sloan Program in Health Administration.
