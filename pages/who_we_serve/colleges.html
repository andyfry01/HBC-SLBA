      HBC-SLBA renders consulting services exclusively for colleges and universities. Compensation is only accepted from college or university clients in the form of consulting fee payments. We do not accept payments from other entities that could provide services for insurance plans, student health and counseling services, or other student health program components. As specified in our <a href="https://hbc-slba/#!/who_we_are/principles">Principles</a>, we maintain our independence as a private sector consulting firm, with no vested interest in promoting specific directions for student health programs.
