		We routinely provide seminars and workshops for current and new clients. Seminars are usually two to four hours in duration. Workshops may vary from half-day, topic-specific sessions to multiple day retreats. The topics shown below are often augmented
		with either responses to either specific questions (refer to <a href="https://hbc-slba.com/#!/what_we_do/inquiries">Common Inquiries</a>) or questions that arrise under HBC's standard <a href="https://hbc-slba.com/#!/what_we_do/services">Services</a>.
		HBC often often works collaboratively with our client's students, faculty, staff, program leadership, and and other key stakeholders to jointly conduct seminars and workshops.</p>
