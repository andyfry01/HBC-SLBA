	<h1 class="mb-5" id="focus-target">Common Inquiries</h1>


	<p>The following are common inquiries from college and university senior institutional leadership and/or College
		Health Program executives.</p>


	<h2>Healthcare Policy and the Affordable Care Act</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				"How has the Affordable Care Act both directly and indirectly affected the need for our student health
				program; and what is the impact on funding options for our health and counseling services?"
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				"Does the Affordable Care Act recognize the existence of our health and counseling services program? If
				so, what are the ramifications for how these services can operate and be funded?"
			</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>
				"What is the practical availability of health insurance for college students through parents’ insurance,
				Medicaid, and our state insurance exchanges with premium subsidies? Do we still need a student health
				insurance plan?"
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				"We are seeing an increasing number of students who have high deductible health insurance plans. We are
				also seeing more students with plans that do not have participating providers in our area. How do we
				address the concerns related to access to local services for these students? What are other emerging
				short- and long-term trends for employer-sponsored and other health insurance that might affect our
				students and our student health program?"
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>College Health Funding Models

	</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				"We heard about a ‘Triple Choice’ program that HB&L has helped to implement, whereby three health care
				access options are provided to students/parents rather than a traditional health fee and student health
				insurance plan. Is this an option for us, and how would we implement such a program?”
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				"Our health and counseling budget hasn’t been keeping up with our increasing expenses. Our use of
				reserve funds to cover losses is not sustainable, and university leadership is questioning our budgetary
				requests. Is our budget request reasonable, and how do we demonstrate this? How can we increase
				revenues, decrease expenses, and/or change our service model to meet our budget without compromising the
				ability to fulfill our mission?"
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				"Could the health fee be eliminated or lowered if we bill students’ private insurance for health care
				and counseling services? What are the advantages and disadvantages of billing students’ personal health
				insurance?
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				"Why does HB&L recommend evaluation of the regulatory environment in each state as a key step in
				determining the options for insurance billing? Why can't we simply adopt an insurance billing system
				that another university in our state has already implemented?
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>


	<h2>Strategic Planning/Program Review</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				"We are facing major changes in our student affairs division that will affect the operation of our
				student health program. What can HB&L provide to help us facilitate that understanding, manage
				transitions, and develop stakeholder buy-in?”
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				"We seem to have many conditions of excellence within our student health program, and we’re anxious to
				have confirmation from an independent consultation. Can HB&L address our program strengths and
				address any key issues within a comprehensive review, such as the possible need for a new health and
				wellness service facility versus renovation of an existing building?”
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				"We are planning on replacing or renovating our out-of-date building. Our current facility constraints
				have impacted our processes, productivity, and service mix; and we don’t want to assume that what we do
				now is what we should do in a new space. Can HB&L help us define our program services and processes,
				and our functional needs for a new facility?”
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				"Our student health program director will be retiring in the near future. We think we have a great
				program, but we want to be sure we have a solid strategic plan for the future. Can HB&L help us in
				identifying both strengths and areas for improvement in formulating a strategic plan?”
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>

				"External stakeholders have suggested that the productivity of the providers at our student health
				center is low. Is this a valid perspective? If yes, what can be done to improve the situation without
				adversely affecting quality of care or student satisfaction?”
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Mental Health Service Delivery</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				"Can HB&L help us to consider all of the current strategies for responding to what is increasingly
				proven to to be an inexorable demand for both short- and long-term counseling services? How do we
				determine which strategies are best for our college?"
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				"We are told that there is a shortage of counselors in our community, but we think that what we really
				have is a shortage of counselors willing to participate with commercial health insurance plans. We heard
				that some schools have solved this problem by directly contracting with local behavioral health care
				providers. Is this a viable option for us and what are the keys to successful negotiations with the
				counselors?"
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Employee Health</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				"Our Human Resources Office would like to visit with us about expanding our student health center to
				provide care for employees. We tried this in the 1990s, and it didn’t seem to work well. What is
				different now, and what are the key factors for the program to be successful in benefiting both students
				and employees?"
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Health Informatics and Technology</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				"Our auditors have recommended a comprehensive IT consultation for our health center and counseling
				center that includes electronic health records, HIPAA/FERPA compliance, and practice management systems.
				Can HB&L provide this service?”
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Student Health Insurance Benefit Plan Design and Management</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				"It is time for us to rebid our student insurance plan. Can HB&L help us in managing the request for
				proposals process? We are also thinking about including an option for self-funding our student health
				plan. Can HB&L help us to evaluate self-funding as an option in our RFP?"
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Outsourcing/Community Partnerships (Co-sourcing)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>
				"Could we develop a partnership with local health care providers for operation of both the health and
				counseling service and the student health insurance program that would be advantageous to our students?
				Could some of our existing services be more effectively provided through such partnerships? Are there
				options for these kinds of partnerships where some or all of the staff remain university employees?"
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
