	<p>
		HB&L routinely provides seminars and workshops for current and new clients. Seminars are usually two to four
		hours in duration. Workshops may vary from half-day, topic-specific sessions to multiple-day retreats. The
		topics shown below are often augmented with responses to either specific questions (refer to <a
			href="/#!/what_we_do/inquiries">Common Inquiries</a>) or questions that arise under HB&L's standard <a
			href="/#!/what_we_do/services">Services</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition to HB&L's <a href="/#!/who_we_are/consultants">Consultants</a>, speakers and facilitators often
		include nationally recognized insurance/health care regulatory law attorneys, actuaries, managed care/direct
		provider specialists, HIPAA/FERPA consultants, risk managers, insurance billing/coding consultants, and other
		experts. HB&L works collaboratively with our clients' program leadership, students, faculty, staff, and other key
		stakeholders to conduct seminars and workshops.
