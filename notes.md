2. Ask Steve which pages from the table represent which existing pages so we can copy that content over - DONE

- Add requisite buttons to these new divs which take you to the right pages  - DONE
- Add who/what/who to the menu bar.... somehow
- configure router for the who/what/who endpoints - DONE
- set up folder directory for who/what/who pages - DONE
