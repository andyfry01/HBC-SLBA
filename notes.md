# Todo list:

## Planning
1. Check table that steve sent, go over different pages that are required
2. Ask Steve which pages from the table represent which existing pages so we can copy that content over
3.

## Development
- Who/What/Who should open up a new div with subsections (see table)
- Add requisite buttons to these new divs which take you to the right pages
- Add who/what/who to the menu bar.... somehow
- configure router for the who/what/who endpoints
- set up folder directory for who/what/who pages
